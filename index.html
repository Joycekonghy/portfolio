    <!-- ABOUT -->
    <section id="about" class="about">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a full stack developer. I want to build technology that helps people — especially in healthcare.
        <br />
        I first got into tech through gaming, getting completely lost in digital worlds and slowly realizing I wanted to understand how they were built. That curiosity grew into a love for programming, and eventually into something more serious: a belief that tech could make a real difference in the world.
        <br />
        That belief led me to co-found HealWare, a platform that uses AI to help people understand allergens based on chemical structures. We didn’t just want to make predictions — we wanted our system to explain itself, because I believe explainable AI is where healthcare needs to go. People deserve to know why a system recommends something, not just what it says.
        <br />  
        Whether it's through apps, data systems, or tools for clinical use, I want to keep building things that bring clarity, empathy, and real value to people. That’s what motivates me — not just the code, but the impact it can have.
