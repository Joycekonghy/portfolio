    <!-- ABOUT -->
    <section id="about" class="about">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Full Stack Developer passionate about AI, computer science, and crafting immersive 
        digital experiences.  fell in love with tech through gaming. As a kid, I’d spend hours getting lost in those pixelated worlds—completely hooked. But it wasn’t just about playing. I started wondering how it all worked. How did someone take an idea and turn it into this whole universe I could explore on a screen?

        That curiosity never really went away. It grew. I started asking bigger questions, messing around with code, learning bit by bit. Eventually, that led me into AI and computer science. And once I got into it, I was all in.
        
        Over time, I learned how to build things from both the inside and out—front-end, back-end, the whole stack. I realized I could actually create the kinds of experiences I used to lose myself in.
        
        Now, I focus on building interactive apps that aren’t just cool or clever, but that help people feel something—more connected, more curious, more human. That’s what keeps me going. That feeling of bringing people together through something I built. That’s the real magic for me.
